   - Create new project or select "kitchensync-4aa93"
   - Enable Google Calendar API
   - Create OAuth 2.0 credentials (Web application)
   - Add redirect URIs:
     - `http://localhost:5173/auth/google/callback` (dev)
     - `https://yourdomain.com/auth/google/callback` (prod)

2. **Environment Variables:**
   Add to `.env.local`:
   ```
   VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here.apps.googleusercontent.com
   VITE_GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

3. **Usage:**
