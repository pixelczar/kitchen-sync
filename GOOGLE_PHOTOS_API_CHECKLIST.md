# Google Photos API Troubleshooting Checklist

Since your token has the correct scopes but you're still getting 403 errors, let's check these potential issues:

## ‚úÖ **What We Know Works**
- OAuth scopes are correctly configured in Google Cloud Console
- Token is valid and has the right scopes
- OAuth flow is working

## üîç **Potential Issues to Check**

### 1. **Google Photos Library API Not Enabled**
- Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
- Navigate to **APIs & Services > Library**
- Search for "Photos Library API"
- Make sure it's **enabled** for your project
- If not enabled, click "Enable"

### 2. **OAuth Consent Screen Status**
- Go to **APIs & Services > OAuth consent screen**
- Check if your app is in "Testing" mode
- If in testing mode:
  - Add your email as a test user, OR
  - Publish the app (if ready for production)

### 3. **API Quotas and Limits**
- Go to **APIs & Services > Quotas**
- Search for "Photos Library API"
- Check if you've hit any quota limits

### 4. **Token Expiration**
- Your token might be expired
- Try disconnecting and reconnecting Google Photos

### 5. **CORS Issues**
- The API calls might be blocked by CORS
- This is less likely since you're getting 403, not CORS errors

## üõ†Ô∏è **Debug Steps**

1. **Use the enhanced debug button** in your app settings
2. **Check the detailed error response** in the console
3. **Verify API is enabled** in Google Cloud Console
4. **Check OAuth consent screen status**

## üéØ **Most Likely Issues**

Based on your symptoms, the most likely issues are:

1. **Photos Library API not enabled** (most common)
2. **OAuth consent screen in testing mode** without test users
3. **Token expired** (less likely since it shows as valid)

## üöÄ **Quick Fixes to Try**

1. **Enable Photos Library API** in Google Cloud Console
2. **Add yourself as a test user** in OAuth consent screen
3. **Disconnect and re-connect** Google Photos in your app
4. **Check the detailed debug output** for more specific error information
