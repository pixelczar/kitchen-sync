## Next Sprint: Week 6 - Branding & Rewards System

### Planned
- [ ] Login page with authentication flow
- [ ] KitchenSync branding across all UI elements (loaders, login pages, handoff pages)
- [ ] Todo & Kudos rewards system with points
- [ ] Rewards catalog or achievement system
- [ ] Two-way Google Calendar sync (create events in app → Google Calendar)
- [ ] Performance optimization and bundle size reduction
- [ ] Tablet deployment and testing
- [ ] Production deployment

## Known Issues

- Firebase quota exceeded errors (RESOLVED - optimized sync operations)
- Google Calendar OAuth scope verification (RESOLVED - app verification process)
- All-day events pushing down time grid inconsistently (RESOLVED - fixed offset system)

---

## Recent Decisions

See [`docs/decisions.md`](decisions.md) for full Architecture Decision Records.

**October 18, 2025:**
- ADR-005: Single batch query for Google Calendar sync (performance optimization)
- ADR-006: 6am time grid start for better early morning coverage
- ADR-007: Fixed all-day events offset using maximum height across days
- ADR-008: 30-minute sync frequency to prevent Firebase quota issues

**October 15, 2025:**
- ADR-001: Batched Firestore writes (performance optimization)
- ADR-002: Zustand over Redux (lightweight state management)
- ADR-003: React Query polling vs real-time (avoid animation jank)
- ADR-004: Web-first PWA, Capacitor later (faster initial deployment)

## Metrics (To Be Tracked)

### Performance (Target Device: Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+)
- **First render:** Target < 1s, Actual: _TBD_
- **Page transition:** Target < 300ms @ 60fps, Actual: _TBD_
- **Checkbox response:** Target < 100ms, Actual: _TBD_
- **Celebration animation:** Target 60fps, Actual: _TBD_

### Bundle Size
- **Initial bundle (gzipped):** Target < 500KB, Actual: _TBD_

### Firestore Usage
- **Writes per day:** Target < 1,000, Actual: _TBD_
- **Reads per day:** Target < 10,000, Actual: _TBD_

_Metrics will be populated once app is running._

## Weekly Summary

### Week 4 (Oct 18, 2025)
**Focus:** Google Calendar integration, calendar optimization, and Firebase performance

**Completed:**
- Google Calendar OAuth flow and API integration
- Google Photos OAuth flow and API integration
- Calendar time grid optimization (6am start, fixed all-day events)
- Event details modal with click-to-view functionality
- Calendar color coding by source (Google vs manual events)
- Timezone picker in settings
- Current time line on today's column
- Firebase sync optimization (95% reduction in database operations)
- Event deduplication and alignment fixes

**Lessons Learned:**
- Firebase quota issues can be resolved with batch operations and smart change detection
- Calendar time grids need consistent offset systems for all-day events
- Google OAuth requires proper app verification for production use
- Single batch queries are much more efficient than individual event checks

**Next Week:**
- Two-way Google Calendar sync (create events in app → Google Calendar)
- Performance optimization and bundle size reduction
- Tablet deployment and testing
- Final UI polish and responsive design

### Week 0 (Oct 15, 2025)
**Focus:** Documentation & architecture planning

**Completed:**
- Comprehensive spec written (product + technical + design)
- Documentation structure established
- Task breakdown for 5-week build
- Key architectural decisions made

**Lessons Learned:**
- Batched writes are critical for performance on budget tablets
- Need to order hardware immediately to test animations
- Two-layer state management (Zustand + React Query) reduces complexity

**Next Week:**
- Get project running locally
- Set up Firebase
- Order tablet hardware
- Build first components

## Milestones

- [x] **Week 1-2:** MVP Foundation - Basic dashboard with person cards, calendar widget, photo screensaver
- [x] **Week 3:** Recognition & Polish - Kudos system, streaks, celebration animations
- [x] **Week 4:** Google Integration - Google Calendar OAuth, Google Photos OAuth, calendar optimization
- [ ] **Week 5:** Final Polish - Two-way sync, performance optimization, tablet deployment
- [ ] **Deploy:** Production deployment to tablet

## Open Questions

1. **Tablet delivery timeline?** - Need to order ASAP to hit Week 1 testing goals
2. **Google API quotas** - Will free tier suffice for development? (Likely yes, but verify)
3. **OpenAI costs** - Estimate $5/month for email parsing, acceptable?
4. **Photo storage** - Use Google Photos URLs directly or download to Firebase Storage? (Decision: Direct URLs for Phase 1)

---

## Notes

- Documentation scaffolding took ~2 hours, worth it for context clarity
- `.cursorrules` already in place with strong development guidelines
- Performance budget is aggressive but necessary to compete with Skylight/Hearth
- Family is excited - keep momentum going!

**Next Update:** End of Week 5 (target: Oct 25, 2025)
