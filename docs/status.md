## Next Sprint: Week 1 - MVP Foundation Begins

### Planned
- [ ] Initialize Vite project with React + TypeScript
- [ ] Install dependencies (Tailwind, Framer Motion, Zustand, React Query, Firebase)
- [ ] Set up Firebase project (Firestore, Auth, Storage)
- [ ] Configure design system in Tailwind
- [ ] **Order Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+** (critical for performance testing)

## Known Issues

None yet - project just starting!

## Recent Decisions

See [`docs/decisions.md`](decisions.md) for full Architecture Decision Records.

**October 15, 2025:**
- ADR-001: Batched Firestore writes (performance optimization)
- ADR-002: Zustand over Redux (lightweight state management)
- ADR-003: React Query polling vs real-time (avoid animation jank)
- ADR-004: Web-first PWA, Capacitor later (faster initial deployment)

---

## Metrics (To Be Tracked)

### Performance (Target Device: Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+)
- **First render:** Target < 1s, Actual: _TBD_
- **Page transition:** Target < 300ms @ 60fps, Actual: _TBD_
- **Checkbox response:** Target < 100ms, Actual: _TBD_
- **Celebration animation:** Target 60fps, Actual: _TBD_

### Bundle Size
- **Initial bundle (gzipped):** Target < 500KB, Actual: _TBD_

### Firestore Usage
- **Writes per day:** Target < 1,000, Actual: _TBD_
- **Reads per day:** Target < 10,000, Actual: _TBD_

_Metrics will be populated once app is running._

## Weekly Summary

### Week 0 (Oct 15, 2025)
**Focus:** Documentation & architecture planning

**Completed:**
- Comprehensive spec written (product + technical + design)
- Documentation structure established
- Task breakdown for 5-week build
- Key architectural decisions made

**Lessons Learned:**
- Batched writes are critical for performance on budget tablets
- Need to order hardware immediately to test animations
- Two-layer state management (Zustand + React Query) reduces complexity

**Next Week:**
- Get project running locally
- Set up Firebase
- Order tablet hardware
- Build first components

---

## Milestones

- [ ] **Week 1-2:** MVP Foundation - Basic dashboard with person cards, calendar widget, photo screensaver
- [ ] **Week 3:** Recognition & Polish - Kudos system, streaks, celebration animations
- [ ] **Week 4:** Settings & Mobile - Full settings panel, mobile companion responsive
- [ ] **Week 5+:** Smart Features - Email-to-calendar, AI photo curation, busy week alerts
- [ ] **Deploy:** Production deployment to tablet

---

## Open Questions

1. **Tablet delivery timeline?** - Need to order ASAP to hit Week 1 testing goals
2. **Google API quotas** - Will free tier suffice for development? (Likely yes, but verify)
3. **OpenAI costs** - Estimate $5/month for email parsing, acceptable?
4. **Photo storage** - Use Google Photos URLs directly or download to Firebase Storage? (Decision: Direct URLs for Phase 1)

---

## Notes

- Documentation scaffolding took ~2 hours, worth it for context clarity
- `.cursorrules` already in place with strong development guidelines
- Performance budget is aggressive but necessary to compete with Skylight/Hearth
- Family is excited - keep momentum going!

**Next Update:** End of Week 1 (target: Oct 22, 2025)
